This technology stack leverages the power of modern web technologies, cloud-native services, and robust AI/ML frameworks to build a scalable, efficient, and intelligent AI-powered salesperson chat system. The combination of TypeScript and React for the frontend, Python for the backend, and Google Cloud Platform services ensures a high-performance, secure, and easily maintainable system architecture.

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION

The AI-powered salesperson chat system will implement a robust authentication and authorization mechanism to ensure secure access and appropriate permissions for different user roles.

1. Authentication:
   - OAuth 2.0 will be used as the primary authentication protocol, integrated with Google Cloud Identity Platform.
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be enforced for all admin accounts and optional for other users.
   - Password policies will enforce strong passwords with regular rotation requirements.

2. Authorization:
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) will be implemented using Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM).
   - The following roles will be defined:
     - Customer: Limited access to chat interface and own quotes
     - Sales Representative: Access to chat interface, quote generation, and customer data
     - Admin: Full access to all system features and configurations
     - System: Used for service-to-service communication

3. JWT (JSON Web Tokens):
   - JWTs will be used for maintaining user sessions and securing API requests.
   - Tokens will be short-lived (1 hour) with refresh token functionality for extended sessions.

4. API Security:
   - All API endpoints will require authentication using JWT.
   - Rate limiting will be implemented to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.

```typescript
// Example of JWT authentication middleware in Express.js
import { expressjwt } from 'express-jwt';
import jwksRsa from 'jwks-rsa';

const checkJwt = expressjwt({
  secret: jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret({
    cache: true,
    rateLimit: true,
    jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,
    jwksUri: `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/.well-known/jwks.json`
  }),
  audience: 'YOUR_API_IDENTIFIER',
  issuer: `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/`,
  algorithms: ['RS256']
});

app.use(checkJwt);
```

### DATA SECURITY

Protecting sensitive information is crucial for maintaining trust and compliance. The following measures will be implemented:

1. Encryption:
   - All data at rest will be encrypted using AES-256 encryption.
   - Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) will be used for key management.
   - All data in transit will be encrypted using TLS 1.3.

2. Data Classification:
   - A data classification system will be implemented to categorize data based on sensitivity.
   - Access controls and security measures will be applied based on data classification.

| Classification | Description | Example | Security Measures |
|----------------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Public | Non-sensitive information | Product catalogs | No special measures |
| Internal | Business data not for public | Sales reports | Encryption, access controls |
| Confidential | Sensitive business data | Customer lists | Strong encryption, strict access controls, audit logging |
| Restricted | Highly sensitive data | Payment information | Strongest encryption, multi-factor auth, data masking |

3. Data Masking:
   - Sensitive data will be masked in logs and non-production environments.
   - Implement data anonymization techniques for analytics and reporting.

4. Secure File Handling:
   - All file uploads will be scanned for malware using Google Cloud Security Scanner.
   - Implement strict file type and size restrictions.
   - Store files in Google Cloud Storage with appropriate access controls.

5. Database Security:
   - Use Google Cloud SQL with encrypted connections and automated backups.
   - Implement database-level access controls and auditing.
   - Regular security patching and updates for database systems.

```python
# Example of data masking in Python
import re

def mask_pii(text):
    # Mask email addresses
    text = re.sub(r'(\w{1})\w+@(\w+\.)', r'\1****@\2', text)
    # Mask phone numbers
    text = re.sub(r'(\d{3})\d{3}(\d{4})', r'\1-***-\2', text)
    return text

# Usage
masked_text = mask_pii("Contact: john.doe@example.com, 123-456-7890")
print(masked_text)
# Output: Contact: j****@example.com, 123-***-7890
```

### SECURITY PROTOCOLS

The following security protocols and procedures will be implemented to maintain system security:

1. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL):
   - Implement security checks at each stage of the development process.
   - Regular code reviews with a focus on security vulnerabilities.
   - Automated security scanning integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

2. Vulnerability Management:
   - Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
   - Use of Google Cloud Security Command Center for centralized security management.
   - Implement a responsible disclosure program for external security researchers.

3. Incident Response Plan:
   - Develop and maintain a comprehensive incident response plan.
   - Regular drills and simulations to test the incident response process.
   - Integration with Google Cloud's security incident management tools.

4. Access Control:
   - Implement the principle of least privilege for all system access.
   - Regular access reviews and prompt revocation of unnecessary privileges.
   - Use of short-lived credentials and just-in-time access for sensitive operations.

5. Monitoring and Logging:
   - Implement comprehensive logging using Google Cloud Logging.
   - Set up real-time alerts for suspicious activities.
   - Retain logs for at least one year for audit and investigation purposes.

6. Network Security:
   - Implement network segmentation using Google Cloud VPC.
   - Use of Web Application Firewall (WAF) for protecting web applications.
   - Regular network penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.

7. Compliance:
   - Ensure compliance with relevant standards (e.g., SOC 2, PCI-DSS if handling payment data).
   - Regular compliance audits and assessments.
   - Maintain up-to-date documentation of security controls and procedures.
