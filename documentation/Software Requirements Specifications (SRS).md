    N -->|Yes| P[Save Quote to CRM]
    P --> Q[Send Quote to User]
    Q --> R[Update Audit Trail]
    R --> S[End]
```

This flowchart outlines the main steps in the quoting process:

1. The process begins when a user (customer or sales representative) initiates a chat session.
2. The system authenticates the user based on their role.
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP) interprets the user's input.
4. If the input is incomplete, the AI prompts for additional information.
5. Once the input is complete, the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system retrieves relevant data.
6. The Quote Generation Engine processes the information.
7. The system integrates with the SKU catalog and calculates dynamic pricing.
8. A structured quote is generated and presented to the user.
9. If the user requests changes, the process loops back to the input stage.
10. Upon approval, the quote is saved to the CRM, sent to the user, and the audit trail is updated.

This process ensures a seamless, AI-driven experience for both customers and sales representatives, leveraging the power of NLP, RAG, and integration with existing systems to provide accurate and efficient quoting.

   - Firestore provides automatic scaling and high availability, suitable for the real-time nature of the chat system.

2. Blob Storage:
   - Google Cloud Storage will be used for storing large files such as product images, technical drawings, and documents.
   - This ensures efficient retrieval and management of binary data associated with quotes and products.

3. Data Retention:
   - Customer data and quotes will be retained for 7 years to comply with business and regulatory requirements.
   - Chat session logs will be retained for 1 year for quality assurance and training purposes.
   - Implement a data lifecycle management policy using Google Cloud Storage object lifecycle management.

```python
from google.cloud import storage

def set_retention_policy(bucket_name, retention_period_days):
    storage_client = storage.Client()
    bucket = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)
    
    bucket.retention_period = retention_period_days * 24 * 3600  # Convert days to seconds
    bucket.patch()

# Usage
set_retention_policy('customer-data-bucket', 365 * 7)  # 7 years retention
set_retention_policy('chat-logs-bucket', 365)  # 1 year retention
```

4. Data Redundancy:
   - Utilize Google Cloud Firestore's built-in replication across multiple regions to ensure data redundancy.
   - Implement multi-region storage for Google Cloud Storage buckets to provide geo-redundancy for blob data.

5. Backup and Recovery:
   - Implement daily automated backups of Firestore data using Google Cloud Firestore export feature.
   - Use Google Cloud Storage Transfer Service to create regular backups of blob data to a separate backup bucket.
   - Develop and test a comprehensive disaster recovery plan, including regular restore drills.

```python
from google.cloud import firestore_admin_v1

def backup_firestore(project_id, backup_bucket):
    client = firestore_admin_v1.FirestoreAdminClient()
    database_name = client.database_path(project_id, '(default)')
    
    output_uri_prefix = f"gs://{backup_bucket}/firestore_backups"
    
    response = client.export_documents(
        request={
            "name": database_name,
            "output_uri_prefix": output_uri_prefix,
        }
    )
    print(f"Backup operation started: {response.name}")

# Usage
backup_firestore('my-project-id', 'my-backup-bucket')
```

   - Use Google Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) for managing encryption keys.
   - Apply Google Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management) for fine-grained access control to data and services.
   - Implement data masking for sensitive information in logs and non-production environments.

```python
from google.cloud import kms

def encrypt_sensitive_data(project_id, location_id, key_ring_id, crypto_key_id, plaintext):
    client = kms.KeyManagementServiceClient()
    key_name = client.crypto_key_path(project_id, location_id, key_ring_id, crypto_key_id)
    
    encrypt_response = client.encrypt(request={'name': key_name, 'plaintext': plaintext.encode('utf-8')})
    return encrypt_response.ciphertext

# Usage
encrypted_data = encrypt_sensitive_data('my-project', 'global', 'my-key-ring', 'my-crypto-key', 'sensitive information')
```

7. Audit Logging:

  const [socket, setSocket] = useState<WebSocket | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.example.com/chat');
    
    ws.onopen = () => {
      console.log('WebSocket connection established');
    };

    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      console.log('Received message:', event.data);
    };

    setSocket(ws);

    return () => {
      ws.close();
    };
  }, []);

  // Component JSX
};
```

3. gRPC

```python
# Example of publishing a message to Google Cloud Pub/Sub
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

def publish_quote_generated(project_id: str, topic_id: str, quote_id: str):
    publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
    topic_path = publisher.topic_path(project_id, topic_id)
    
    data = f"Quote generated: {quote_id}".encode("utf-8")
    future = publisher.publish(topic_path, data)
    print(f"Published message ID: {future.result()}")
```

These communication interfaces ensure that the AI-powered salesperson chat system can securely and efficiently exchange data with all necessary components and external systems, providing a seamless and responsive experience for users while maintaining data integrity and system performance.
